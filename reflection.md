Things I have learned from this activity
I have learned more about CPUs and their capabilaties to do amazing things inside of a computer and how without it the computer will not function. I learned a lot about the compitition between amd and intel and I will be better prepared to buy a good cpu the next time I purchase a PC.



Things I still want to learn
I would really like to learn how to overclock to really make use of an AMD cpu so when i buy a PC i wnt have to get another expencive graphics card I can use the integrated AMD graphics to play non demanding games without spending a lot of money on extra hardware.
