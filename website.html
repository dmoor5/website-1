<h1>Computer CPUs</h1>
<p id="p1"><strong>CPU</strong> or <em>central prosessing unit</em> are the brains of a computer and without them commputers would not be able to function properly.
The CPUs job is to carry out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output  operations specified by the instructions. </p>
<h2> History</h2>

<h2> Cpu Cores and Overclocking</h2>
<p> Most CPUs have more than 1 core for multiple reasons. Cpu cores can be split up and dedicated to doing several tasks on a computerto increase the efficiancy of the computer. Overclocking is somthing someone might do to increase the preformance of their pc. It involves using more cores or threads than the prossesser is ment to use to get better megaherts or gigaherts per second which results in faster preformance for things that require higher end computers like gaming and video editing. 

<h2>Types of CPUs (Intel vs AMD)</h2>
<p> AMD and Intel ar the two main prossesor providers in the market righht now. Although Intel is currently more popular and has better single core preformance, there are some advantages in buying an AMD prossesor depending on what you are doing with your computer. For example, AMD tends to have cheeper budget options if you are looking to buy a computer for basic things such as writing documents and browsing the internet. Also, higher end AMD prossesors will have more useable cores than an Intel high end prossesor which is good if you are planning to overclock your pc. Here is a table to help you make a good purchase for your needs;

                <td>When you are doing simple things like browsing the web and watching videos I would reccomend AMD as it is cheeper than it's Intel competitor and can give you all the cpu power you would need for a school computer.I would insted spend my money on more memory (RAM) as it will help you run 1 or more videos at once and increase the amount of tabs you can have open in chrome before crashing.<br> <strong> Winner= AMD A6 3500</strong></td>

<h1 id="h1">Conclusion</h1>
<h3 id="intel">Intel</h3>
<p id="intel-p">In general, you should be buying an Intel proscessor if you are new to computers and don't know how to overclock or optimize AMD procsessors to reach their fullest potential. Intel CPUs have great preformance in some cores but nnot in all of them and they often have less cores in general than AMD which makes intel great for beginners who don't know much about CPUs and would rather pay more money so that their CPU comes completly ready to go and do almost whatever you want it to do. </p>
